# LA-County-Parks-and-Recreation-Mobile-App

## Introduction
>The Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation oversees over 70,000 acres and manages 182 parks across Los Angeles County. To provide a better service to LA County Park visitors, the Department of Parks and Recreation partnered with CSULA to build the first LA County Parks and Recreation mobile app. The mobile app makes it easy for potential visitors to discover new parks. They may search for parks based on location and may filter parks to find those that offer any combination of the 83 available amenities. Users are able to download high-resolution maps of parks so that they can better understand the layout of the park and reorient themselves if they get lost. After a user visits a park, they may submit a review to Parks and Recreation staff. The review can include suggestions for improvement or issues they found in the park. Finally, visitors may opt-in for emergency alert push notifications so that staff can quickly notify users when necessary.
